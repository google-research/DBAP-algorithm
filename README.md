Algorithm code for AWAC and DBAP.

Based on the publication: Demonstration Augmented Autonomous Practicing for Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning.

Code for multi-task reset-free reinforcement learning using graph-search and offline RL.

Refer to example_awac_script for necessary runfiles.

Base directory has most of the data and configuration files, all of the algorithm code can be found inside third_party/rlkit.
